		<h2>What is this site?</h2>
		<p>Hello my name is 0x4248 (also known as blix) and I own this domain.
			This domain is mostly a joke but some services are served here.
		</p>

		<h2>LGBTQ+ charities and non profit organisations</h2>
		<p><i>Across the world, many LGBTQ+ people face <strong>discrimination, violence, and even death</strong> because of who they are and who they love. Some LGBTQ+ charities and non profit organisations can help with this problem and provide support to thoes who are in need:</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.stonewall.org.uk/">Stonewall</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.lgbt.foundation/">LGBT Foundation</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.hrc.org/">Human Rights Campaign</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.trevorproject.org/">The Trevor Project</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Across the UK and around the world people have also been fighting for
			Transgender and Non-Binary rights. <strong>If you are a legal UK resident</strong> you can
			sign this petition to make the labour government to consider legally recognising
			Non-Binary people. <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/700312">Sign the petition</a></p>
